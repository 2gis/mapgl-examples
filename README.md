# MapGL Examples

The repository contains rough examples of using [2GIS MapGL API](https://dev.2gis.com/). You can check these examples on [2gis.github.io/mapgl-examples](https://2gis.github.io/mapgl-examples) page.

More official examples with detailed descriptions can be found in the documentation on [docs.2gis.com](https://docs.2gis.com/en/mapgl/overview).

## Contributing

For the examples to work well, all of them have to meet the following conditions:

1. example code is stored in the separate folder in `src`
2. example has `index.html` file
3. `index.html` of each example should have `title` tag and `meta:description` tag
